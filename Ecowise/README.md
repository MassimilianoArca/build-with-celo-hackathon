#### Project Description
Ecowise  is a project with the aim of fighting climate change by increasing the awareness of
each individual in the scenario of household energy consumption. It consists of a dApp that keeps track of the different categories of energy consumption of a given house, i.e. electricity, water, and gas by assigning prizes to the most virtuous.
At first, the user will have to log in through a wallet. Once logged in, it will be required to compile a small survey to collect info for categorizing the user, such as the number of people living in the house and the square footage of the house. Then every user will have to upload the various bills in order to track his consumption. An image detection model will take only the meter code (distinct for every house) and the amount of consumption by month. The former is needed as proof of authenticity of all future bills that will have to be referred to the same house, while the latter is needed to quantify the actual emissions. The needed data will be stored on the blockchain, while the useless one will be ignored.
Every user will be able to see and update the history of his/her consumptions, as well as compare them with the average ones of the category he/she belongs to (which are taken from an oracle) and to his consumption of the previous year.
Depending on whether the consumption taken from the bill is higher or lower than the average country consumption of the category and the own user consumption of the previous year, the user will receive a reward or a malus. The reward can be used to make purchases on a marketplace. The products will be linked to several initiatives connected with environmental protection.
This will allow users to invest their reward in environmental-themed initiatives that can thus be advertised through the app.
